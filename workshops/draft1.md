# First workshop plan:
Developed by Ihor & Andre 28/06/2020

The idea for this workshop is to introduce participants to physical computing and programming. To do this, we will use BeeHive and its training board.
- given that we are using micropython and can use jupyter notebooks to control the board, this will be handy as participants will leave the workshop with very good grips
on how to use these two tools (Python and Jupyter) that are widely used by biologists/Neuroscientists

Participants do not need to have previous experience with anything to attend this workshop, but need to have their own laptop.


Content:
Users need to prepare their computers for the workshop. Before it starts, they need to install anaconda, micropython kernel and download ESP32 micropython firmware
