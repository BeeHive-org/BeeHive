Micropython-OSC
===============

Micropython-osc (aka `uosc`) is a minimal [Open Sound Control] \(OSC) client
and server library for [MicroPython] and CPython 2 or 3.


Status / Supported Boards
-------------------------

It should work on the Unix, stm32 (Pyboard) and esp8266 port of MicroPython
and under CPython 2.7 and 3.3+. Since OSC is a protocol commonly using an IP
network and UDP or TCP packets as a transport, the main requirement is a
working and compatible `socket` module. Currently this module only supports UDP
as the transport.

The server code so far has only been tested under the Unix port and CPython 2
and 3, but the client portion has been confirmed to work on a ESP-8266 board
running MicroPython 1.8.x.


Usage
-----

Here's a minmal usage example for the client. Further documentation is
currently only available by looking at the docstrings and the source code (the
whole package has a total LLOC of < 400).

    from uosc.client import Bundle, Client, create_message

    osc = Client('192.168.4.2', 9001)
    osc.send('/controls/frobnicator', 42, 3.1419, "spamm")
    b = Bundle()
    b.add(create_message("/foo", bar))
    b.add(create_message("/spamm", 12345))
    osc.send(b)
